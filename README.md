Examples of websites built by me to showcase my skills.

<h1>Watch Website</h1>

<p>This website is a template for a watch website show casing multiple watches from the companies collection. It is a home page that has a banner video, fully working navbar that will jump to different sections of the front page. Three cards that show pictures of the watches with title and discription with links that will bring you to other webpages. The front page is ended with a contact link and a signup for creating an account.
