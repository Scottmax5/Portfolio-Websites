# Portfolio-Websites
Examples of websites built by me to showcase my skills.

This portfolio is a constant work in progress and will be updated as I have completed and added to the repository.

<h1>Watch Website</h1>

<p>This website is a template for a watch website show casing multiple watches from the companies collection. It is a home page that has a banner video, fully working navbar that will jump to different sections of the front page. Three cards that show pictures of the watches with title and description with links that will bring you to other webpages. The front page is ended with a contact link and a signup for creating an account.

The pages that are linked in the cards link to a page displaying the associated watch. These pages showcase the watch, descriptions, collapsible menus to give more information and slideshow displaying pictures of the watch.<p>
